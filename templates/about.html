    TO-do list is just a list of things you have to-do.
    That means basically anything and everything can be on your to-do list—but just because you've written your to-dos down doesn't mean your to-do list is actually useful.
     Effectively tracking when your work is due can help you prioritize and get great work done.
   This is a simple To-Do list application built with Flask and MySQL.</p>
